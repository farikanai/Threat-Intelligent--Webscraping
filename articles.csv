The flaw, assigned the CVE identifier\xa0 CVE-2024-27322 , ""involves the use of promise objects and lazy evaluation in R,"" AI application security company HiddenLayer said in a report shared with The Hacker News. RDS,\xa0 like\xa0pickle\xa0in Python , is a format used to serialize and save the state of data structures or objects in R, an open-source programming language used in statistical computing, data visualization, and machine learning. This process of serialization – serialize() or saveRDS() – and deserialization – unserialize() and readRDS() – is also leveraged when saving and loading R packages. The root cause behind CVE-2024-27322 lies in the fact that it could lead to arbitrary code execution when deserializing untrusted data, thus leavi']"
